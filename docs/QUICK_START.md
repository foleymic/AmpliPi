# Quick Start Guide

Thanks for supporting AmpliPi, we hope you love your new unit!

## Power and Connections

- Plug the unit into 120/220
- Connect the ethernet jack to a network
- Connect at least one set of speakers

## Try it out
1. browse to amplipi.local (for android use the ip address displayed on the unit)
1. Pick a source, using the selector. We recommend `internet radio`
1. Change the volume on the zone you would like to output music on

## Configuration
You will probably want to change the default group and zone names and add different streaming sources. We are planning on having a simple interface for configuring all of this, for now we use the interactive API to change these configurations.

Try is out [amplipi.local/api/doc](amplipi.local/api/doc).
