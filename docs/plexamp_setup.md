# Turning your AmpliPi into a Plexamp Player
This guide will detail multiple ways to setup Plexamp on the AmpliPi system.
## Prerequisites
Regardless of which setup path you take, a few requirements must be met. First, Plexamp must be installed on the Pi. This should come standard with our AmpliPi install. If you find yourself needing to install it, we use a modified copy of Plexamp v1.0.5 for the Pi. Our version can be found here ////////// WHERE CAN IT BE FOUND? ////////////////
You will also need a Plex Pass subscription to be able to discover the device (Plexamp is a subscription-only service).
Finally, Node 9 is required since this is an older version of the Plexamp software ///////////////////// IS THIS STILL NECESSARY??????? //////////////////////
